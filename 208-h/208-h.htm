      PART I
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the little town of Vevey, in Switzerland, there is a particularly
      comfortable hotel. There are, indeed, many hotels, for the entertainment
      of tourists is the business of the place, which, as many travelers will
      remember, is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake&mdash;a lake
      that it behooves every tourist to visit. The shore of the lake presents an
      unbroken array of establishments of this order, of every category, from
      the &ldquo;grand hotel&rdquo; of the newest fashion, with a chalk-white front, a
      hundred balconies, and a dozen flags flying from its roof, to the little
      Swiss pension of an elder day, with its name inscribed in German-looking
      lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the
      angle of the garden. One of the hotels at Vevey, however, is famous, even
      classical, being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an
      air both of luxury and of maturity. In this region, in the month of June,
      American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said, indeed, that
      Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American
      watering place. There are sights and sounds which evoke a vision, an echo,
      of Newport and Saratoga. There is a flitting hither and thither of
      &ldquo;stylish&rdquo; young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces, a rattle of dance
      music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched voices at all times.
      You receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the
      &ldquo;Trois Couronnes&rdquo; and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to
      Congress Hall. But at the &ldquo;Trois Couronnes,&rdquo; it must be added, there are
      other features that are much at variance with these suggestions: neat
      German waiters, who look like secretaries of legation; Russian princesses
      sitting in the garden; little Polish boys walking about held by the hand,
      with their governors; a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and
      the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were
      uppermost in the mind of a young American, who, two or three years ago,
      sat in the garden of the &ldquo;Trois Couronnes,&rdquo; looking about him, rather
      idly, at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned. It was a beautiful
      summer morning, and in whatever fashion the young American looked at
      things, they must have seemed to him charming. He had come from Geneva the
      day before by the little steamer, to see his aunt, who was staying at the
      hotel&mdash;Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence. But
      his aunt had a headache&mdash;his aunt had almost always a headache&mdash;and
      now she was shut up in her room, smelling camphor, so that he was at
      liberty to wander about. He was some seven-and-twenty years of age; when
      his friends spoke of him, they usually said that he was at Geneva
      &ldquo;studying.&rdquo; When his enemies spoke of him, they said&mdash;but, after all,
      he had no enemies; he was an extremely amiable fellow, and universally
      liked. What I should say is, simply, that when certain persons spoke of
      him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva
      was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there&mdash;a
      foreign lady&mdash;a person older than himself. Very few Americans&mdash;indeed,
      I think none&mdash;had ever seen this lady, about whom there were some
      singular stories. But Winterbourne had an old attachment for the little
      metropolis of Calvinism; he had been put to school there as a boy, and he
      had afterward gone to college there&mdash;circumstances which had led to
      his forming a great many youthful friendships. Many of these he had kept,
      and they were a source of great satisfaction to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After knocking at his aunt&rsquo;s door and learning that she was indisposed, he
      had taken a walk about the town, and then he had come in to his breakfast.
      He had now finished his breakfast; but he was drinking a small cup of
      coffee, which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by
      one of the waiters who looked like an attache. At last he finished his
      coffee and lit a cigarette. Presently a small boy came walking along the
      path&mdash;an urchin of nine or ten. The child, who was diminutive for his
      years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale complexion, and sharp
      little features. He was dressed in knickerbockers, with red stockings,
      which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks; he also wore a brilliant
      red cravat. He carried in his hand a long alpenstock, the sharp point of
      which he thrust into everything that he approached&mdash;the flowerbeds,
      the garden benches, the trains of the ladies&rsquo; dresses. In front of
      Winterbourne he paused, looking at him with a pair of bright, penetrating
      little eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me a lump of sugar?&rdquo; he asked in a sharp, hard little voice&mdash;a
      voice immature and yet, somehow, not young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne glanced at the small table near him, on which his coffee
      service rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained. &ldquo;Yes, you
      may take one,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think sugar is good for little
      boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the
      coveted fragments, two of which he buried in the pocket of his
      knickerbockers, depositing the other as promptly in another place. He
      poked his alpenstock, lance-fashion, into Winterbourne&rsquo;s bench and tried
      to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, blazes; it&rsquo;s har-r-d!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a
      peculiar manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of
      claiming him as a fellow countryman. &ldquo;Take care you don&rsquo;t hurt your
      teeth,&rdquo; he said, paternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any teeth to hurt. They have all come out. I have only got
      seven teeth. My mother counted them last night, and one came out right
      afterward. She said she&rsquo;d slap me if any more came out. I can&rsquo;t help it.
      It&rsquo;s this old Europe. It&rsquo;s the climate that makes them come out. In
      America they didn&rsquo;t come out. It&rsquo;s these hotels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne was much amused. &ldquo;If you eat three lumps of sugar, your
      mother will certainly slap you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got to give me some candy, then,&rdquo; rejoined his young interlocutor.
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get any candy here&mdash;any American candy. American candy&rsquo;s the
      best candy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are American little boys the best little boys?&rdquo; asked Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m an American boy,&rdquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are one of the best!&rdquo; laughed Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an American man?&rdquo; pursued this vivacious infant. And then, on
      Winterbourne&rsquo;s affirmative reply&mdash;&ldquo;American men are the best,&rdquo; he
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had now
      got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he attacked
      a second lump of sugar. Winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like
      this in his infancy, for he had been brought to Europe at about this age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes my sister!&rdquo; cried the child in a moment. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an American
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady
      advancing. &ldquo;American girls are the best girls,&rdquo; he said cheerfully to his
      young companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister ain&rsquo;t the best!&rdquo; the child declared. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always blowing at
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine that is your fault, not hers,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. The young
      lady meanwhile had drawn near. She was dressed in white muslin, with a
      hundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon. She was
      bareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep
      border of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. &ldquo;How
      pretty they are!&rdquo; thought Winterbourne, straightening himself in his seat,
      as if he were prepared to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady paused in front of his bench, near the parapet of the
      garden, which overlooked the lake. The little boy had now converted his
      alpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing
      about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Randolph,&rdquo; said the young lady, &ldquo;what ARE you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up the Alps,&rdquo; replied Randolph. &ldquo;This is the way!&rdquo; And he gave
      another little jump, scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne&rsquo;s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they come down,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an American man!&rdquo; cried Randolph, in his little hard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight at
      her brother. &ldquo;Well, I guess you had better be quiet,&rdquo; she simply observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented. He got
      up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his cigarette.
      &ldquo;This little boy and I have made acquaintance,&rdquo; he said, with great
      civility. In Geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a young man was not
      at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely
      occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions could be better
      than these?&mdash;a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of
      you in a garden. This pretty American girl, however, on hearing
      Winterbourne&rsquo;s observation, simply glanced at him; she then turned her
      head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the opposite mountains.
      He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he decided that he must
      advance farther, rather than retreat. While he was thinking of something
      else to say, the young lady turned to the little boy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know where you got that pole,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought it,&rdquo; responded Randolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re going to take it to Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am going to take it to Italy,&rdquo; the child declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot
      or two of ribbon. Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again. &ldquo;Well,
      I guess you had better leave it somewhere,&rdquo; she said after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to Italy?&rdquo; Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady glanced at him again. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied. And she said
      nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;a&mdash;going over the Simplon?&rdquo; Winterbourne pursued, a
      little embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s some mountain. Randolph, what
      mountain are we going over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going where?&rdquo; the child demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Italy,&rdquo; Winterbourne explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Randolph. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to Italy. I want to go
      to America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Italy is a beautiful place!&rdquo; rejoined the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get candy there?&rdquo; Randolph loudly inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;I guess you have had enough candy, and
      mother thinks so too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had any for ever so long&mdash;for a hundred weeks!&rdquo; cried the
      boy, still jumping about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again; and
      Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view.
      He was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive that she
      was not in the least embarrassed herself. There had not been the slightest
      alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently neither offended
      nor flattered. If she looked another way when he spoke to her, and seemed
      not particularly to hear him, this was simply her habit, her manner. Yet,
      as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest
      in the view, with which she appeared quite unacquainted, she gradually
      gave him more of the benefit of her glance; and then he saw that this
      glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking. It was not, however, what
      would have been called an immodest glance, for the young girl&rsquo;s eyes were
      singularly honest and fresh. They were wonderfully pretty eyes; and,
      indeed, Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than
      his fair countrywoman&rsquo;s various features&mdash;her complexion, her nose,
      her ears, her teeth. He had a great relish for feminine beauty; he was
      addicted to observing and analyzing it; and as regards this young lady&rsquo;s
      face he made several observations. It was not at all insipid, but it was
      not exactly expressive; and though it was eminently delicate, Winterbourne
      mentally accused it&mdash;very forgivingly&mdash;of a want of finish. He
      thought it very possible that Master Randolph&rsquo;s sister was a coquette; he
      was sure she had a spirit of her own; but in her bright, sweet,
      superficial little visage there was no mockery, no irony. Before long it
      became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation. She told
      him that they were going to Rome for the winter&mdash;she and her mother
      and Randolph. She asked him if he was a &ldquo;real American&rdquo;; she shouldn&rsquo;t
      have taken him for one; he seemed more like a German&mdash;this was said
      after a little hesitation&mdash;especially when he spoke. Winterbourne,
      laughing, answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans, but
      that he had not, so far as he remembered, met an American who spoke like a
      German. Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting
      upon the bench which he had just quitted. She answered that she liked
      standing up and walking about; but she presently sat down. She told him
      she was from New York State&mdash;&ldquo;if you know where that is.&rdquo;
       Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small,
      slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me your name, my boy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Randolph C. Miller,&rdquo; said the boy sharply. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you her name;&rdquo;
       and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better wait till you are asked!&rdquo; said this young lady calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like very much to know your name,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Daisy Miller!&rdquo; cried the child. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t her real
      name; that isn&rsquo;t her name on her cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you haven&rsquo;t got one of my cards!&rdquo; said Miss Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her real name is Annie P. Miller,&rdquo; the boy went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him HIS name,&rdquo; said his sister, indicating Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to
      supply information with regard to his own family. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s name is
      Ezra B. Miller,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;My father ain&rsquo;t in Europe; my father&rsquo;s in
      a better place than Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the
      child had been taught to intimate that Mr. Miller had been removed to the
      sphere of celestial reward. But Randolph immediately added, &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
      in Schenectady. He&rsquo;s got a big business. My father&rsquo;s rich, you bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Miller, lowering her parasol and looking at the
      embroidered border. Winterbourne presently released the child, who
      departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like
      Europe,&rdquo; said the young girl. &ldquo;He wants to go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Schenectady, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he wants to go right home. He hasn&rsquo;t got any boys here. There is one
      boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won&rsquo;t let him
      play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your brother hasn&rsquo;t any teacher?&rdquo; Winterbourne inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us. There was a
      lady told her of a very good teacher; an American lady&mdash;perhaps you
      know her&mdash;Mrs. Sanders. I think she came from Boston. She told her of
      this teacher, and we thought of getting him to travel round with us. But
      Randolph said he didn&rsquo;t want a teacher traveling round with us. He said he
      wouldn&rsquo;t have lessons when he was in the cars. And we ARE in the cars
      about half the time. There was an English lady we met in the cars&mdash;I
      think her name was Miss Featherstone; perhaps you know her. She wanted to
      know why I didn&rsquo;t give Randolph lessons&mdash;give him &lsquo;instruction,&rsquo; she
      called it. I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give
      him. He&rsquo;s very smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Winterbourne; &ldquo;he seems very smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy. Can
      you get good teachers in Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, I should think,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else she&rsquo;s going to find some school. He ought to learn some more.
      He&rsquo;s only nine. He&rsquo;s going to college.&rdquo; And in this way Miss Miller
      continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other
      topics. She sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with
      very brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now
      resting upon those of Winterbourne, now wandering over the garden, the
      people who passed by, and the beautiful view. She talked to Winterbourne
      as if she had known him a long time. He found it very pleasant. It was
      many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much. It might have
      been said of this unknown young lady, who had come and sat down beside him
      upon a bench, that she chattered. She was very quiet; she sat in a
      charming, tranquil attitude; but her lips and her eyes were constantly
      moving. She had a soft, slender, agreeable voice, and her tone was
      decidedly sociable. She gave Winterbourne a history of her movements and
      intentions and those of her mother and brother, in Europe, and enumerated,
      in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped. &ldquo;That English
      lady in the cars,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Featherstone&mdash;asked me if we
      didn&rsquo;t all live in hotels in America. I told her I had never been in so
      many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe. I have never seen so
      many&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing but hotels.&rdquo; But Miss Miller did not make this
      remark with a querulous accent; she appeared to be in the best humor with
      everything. She declared that the hotels were very good, when once you got
      used to their ways, and that Europe was perfectly sweet. She was not
      disappointed&mdash;not a bit. Perhaps it was because she had heard so much
      about it before. She had ever so many intimate friends that had been there
      ever so many times. And then she had had ever so many dresses and things
      from Paris. Whenever she put on a Paris dress she felt as if she were in
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a kind of a wishing cap,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Miller without examining this analogy; &ldquo;it always made me
      wish I was here. But I needn&rsquo;t have done that for dresses. I am sure they
      send all the pretty ones to America; you see the most frightful things
      here. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;is the society. There
      isn&rsquo;t any society; or, if there is, I don&rsquo;t know where it keeps itself. Do
      you? I suppose there is some society somewhere, but I haven&rsquo;t seen
      anything of it. I&rsquo;m very fond of society, and I have always had a great
      deal of it. I don&rsquo;t mean only in Schenectady, but in New York. I used to
      go to New York every winter. In New York I had lots of society. Last
      winter I had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them were by
      gentlemen,&rdquo; added Daisy Miller. &ldquo;I have more friends in New York than in
      Schenectady&mdash;more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends
      too,&rdquo; she resumed in a moment. She paused again for an instant; she was
      looking at Winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in
      her light, slightly monotonous smile. &ldquo;I have always had,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a
      great deal of gentlemen&rsquo;s society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. He had
      never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion; never,
      at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of
      demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. And yet was he
      to accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they
      said at Geneva? He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he had
      lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the American tone. Never,
      indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had he
      encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this.
      Certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! Was she simply
      a pretty girl from New York State? Were they all like that, the pretty
      girls who had a good deal of gentlemen&rsquo;s society? Or was she also a
      designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? Winterbourne had
      lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him. Miss
      Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent. Some people had told him that,
      after all, American girls were exceedingly innocent; and others had told
      him that, after all, they were not. He was inclined to think Miss Daisy
      Miller was a flirt&mdash;a pretty American flirt. He had never, as yet,
      had any relations with young ladies of this category. He had known, here
      in Europe, two or three women&mdash;persons older than Miss Daisy Miller,
      and provided, for respectability&rsquo;s sake, with husbands&mdash;who were
      great coquettes&mdash;dangerous, terrible women, with whom one&rsquo;s relations
      were liable to take a serious turn. But this young girl was not a coquette
      in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a pretty
      American flirt. Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the
      formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller. He leaned back in his seat; he
      remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen;
      he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of one&rsquo;s
      intercourse with a pretty American flirt. It presently became apparent
      that he was on the way to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been to that old castle?&rdquo; asked the young girl, pointing with
      her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, formerly, more than once,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;You too, I suppose,
      have seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we haven&rsquo;t been there. I want to go there dreadfully. Of course I
      mean to go there. I wouldn&rsquo;t go away from here without having seen that
      old castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very pretty excursion,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;and very easy to make.
      You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go in the cars,&rdquo; said Miss Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you can go in the cars,&rdquo; Winterbourne assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our courier says they take you right up to the castle,&rdquo; the young girl
      continued. &ldquo;We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers
      dreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn&rsquo;t go. Randolph wouldn&rsquo;t go
      either; he says he doesn&rsquo;t think much of old castles. But I guess we&rsquo;ll go
      this week, if we can get Randolph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments?&rdquo; Winterbourne
      inquired, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he don&rsquo;t care much about old castles. He&rsquo;s only nine. He wants to
      stay at the hotel. Mother&rsquo;s afraid to leave him alone, and the courier
      won&rsquo;t stay with him; so we haven&rsquo;t been to many places. But it will be too
      bad if we don&rsquo;t go up there.&rdquo; And Miss Miller pointed again at the Chateau
      de Chillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it might be arranged,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you
      get some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Miller looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, &ldquo;I wish YOU
      would stay with him!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne hesitated a moment. &ldquo;I should much rather go to Chillon with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me?&rdquo; asked the young girl with the same placidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t rise, blushing, as a young girl at Geneva would have done; and
      yet Winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought it
      possible she was offended. &ldquo;With your mother,&rdquo; he answered very
      respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss
      Daisy Miller. &ldquo;I guess my mother won&rsquo;t go, after all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She
      don&rsquo;t like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what
      you said just now&mdash;that you would like to go up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most earnestly,&rdquo; Winterbourne declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we may arrange it. If mother will stay with Randolph, I guess
      Eugenio will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenio?&rdquo; the young man inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenio&rsquo;s our courier. He doesn&rsquo;t like to stay with Randolph; he&rsquo;s the
      most fastidious man I ever saw. But he&rsquo;s a splendid courier. I guess he&rsquo;ll
      stay at home with Randolph if mother does, and then we can go to the
      castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible&mdash;&ldquo;we&rdquo;
       could only mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself. This program seemed almost
      too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young
      lady&rsquo;s hand. Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project,
      but at this moment another person, presumably Eugenio, appeared. A tall,
      handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and a
      brilliant watch chain, approached Miss Miller, looking sharply at her
      companion. &ldquo;Oh, Eugenio!&rdquo; said Miss Miller with the friendliest accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenio had looked at Winterbourne from head to foot; he now bowed gravely
      to the young lady. &ldquo;I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon
      is upon the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Miller slowly rose. &ldquo;See here, Eugenio!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to that
      old castle, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Chateau de Chillon, mademoiselle?&rdquo; the courier inquired.
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle has made arrangements?&rdquo; he added in a tone which struck
      Winterbourne as very impertinent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenio&rsquo;s tone apparently threw, even to Miss Miller&rsquo;s own apprehension, a
      slightly ironical light upon the young girl&rsquo;s situation. She turned to
      Winterbourne, blushing a little&mdash;a very little. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t back out?&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be happy till we go!&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are staying in this hotel?&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;And you are really an
      American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The courier stood looking at Winterbourne offensively. The young man, at
      least, thought his manner of looking an offense to Miss Miller; it
      conveyed an imputation that she &ldquo;picked up&rdquo; acquaintances. &ldquo;I shall have
      the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,&rdquo;
       he said, smiling and referring to his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll go some day,&rdquo; said Miss Miller. And she gave him a smile
      and turned away. She put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside
      Eugenio. Winterbourne stood looking after her; and as she moved away,
      drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that she had
      the tournure of a princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising to
      present his aunt, Mrs. Costello, to Miss Daisy Miller. As soon as the
      former lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her
      apartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her health, he
      asked her if she had observed in the hotel an American family&mdash;a
      mamma, a daughter, and a little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a courier?&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello. &ldquo;Oh yes, I have observed them. Seen
      them&mdash;heard them&mdash;and kept out of their way.&rdquo; Mrs. Costello was
      a widow with a fortune; a person of much distinction, who frequently
      intimated that, if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches,
      she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time. She had a
      long, pale face, a high nose, and a great deal of very striking white
      hair, which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head.
      She had two sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe.
      This young man was amusing himself at Hamburg, and, though he was on his
      travels, was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment
      selected by his mother for her own appearance there. Her nephew, who had
      come up to Vevey expressly to see her, was therefore more attentive than
      those who, as she said, were nearer to her. He had imbibed at Geneva the
      idea that one must always be attentive to one&rsquo;s aunt. Mrs. Costello had
      not seen him for many years, and she was greatly pleased with him,
      manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of
      that social sway which, as she gave him to understand, she exerted in the
      American capital. She admitted that she was very exclusive; but, if he
      were acquainted with New York, he would see that one had to be. And her
      picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that
      city, which she presented to him in many different lights, was, to
      Winterbourne&rsquo;s imagination, almost oppressively striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He immediately perceived, from her tone, that Miss Daisy Miller&rsquo;s place in
      the social scale was low. &ldquo;I am afraid you don&rsquo;t approve of them,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very common,&rdquo; Mrs. Costello declared. &ldquo;They are the sort of
      Americans that one does one&rsquo;s duty by not&mdash;not accepting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t accept them?&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, my dear Frederick. I would if I could, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young girl is very pretty,&rdquo; said Winterbourne in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s pretty. But she is very common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean, of course,&rdquo; said Winterbourne after another pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has that charming look that they all have,&rdquo; his aunt resumed. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t think where they pick it up; and she dresses in perfection&mdash;no,
      you don&rsquo;t know how well she dresses. I can&rsquo;t think where they get their
      taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear aunt, she is not, after all, a Comanche savage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a young lady,&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello, &ldquo;who has an intimacy with her
      mamma&rsquo;s courier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An intimacy with the courier?&rdquo; the young man demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the mother is just as bad! They treat the courier like a familiar
      friend&mdash;like a gentleman. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he dines with them.
      Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners, such fine
      clothes, so like a gentleman. He probably corresponds to the young lady&rsquo;s
      idea of a count. He sits with them in the garden in the evening. I think
      he smokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures; they helped him
      to make up his mind about Miss Daisy. Evidently she was rather wild.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not a courier, and yet she was very charming to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better have said at first,&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello with dignity,
      &ldquo;that you had made her acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We simply met in the garden, and we talked a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tout bonnement! And pray what did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable
      aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to guarantee my respectability,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray who is to guarantee hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are cruel!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very nice young girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say that as if you believed it,&rdquo; Mrs. Costello observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is completely uncultivated,&rdquo; Winterbourne went on. &ldquo;But she is
      wonderfully pretty, and, in short, she is very nice. To prove that I
      believe it, I am going to take her to the Chateau de Chillon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two are going off there together? I should say it proved just the
      contrary. How long had you known her, may I ask, when this interesting
      project was formed? You haven&rsquo;t been twenty-four hours in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known her half an hour!&rdquo; said Winterbourne, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Costello. &ldquo;What a dreadful girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her nephew was silent for some moments. &ldquo;You really think, then,&rdquo; he began
      earnestly, and with a desire for trustworthy information&mdash;&ldquo;you really
      think that&mdash;&rdquo; But he paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what, sir?&rdquo; said his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she is the sort of young lady who expects a man, sooner or later, to
      carry her off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do. But I
      really think that you had better not meddle with little American girls
      that are uncultivated, as you call them. You have lived too long out of
      the country. You will be sure to make some great mistake. You are too
      innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt, I am not so innocent,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, smiling and
      curling his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are guilty too, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let
      the poor girl know you then?&rdquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it literally true that she is going to the Chateau de Chillon with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that she fully intends it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear Frederick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello, &ldquo;I must decline the honor
      of her acquaintance. I am an old woman, but I am not too old, thank
      Heaven, to be shocked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t they all do these things&mdash;the young girls in America?&rdquo;
       Winterbourne inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Costello stared a moment. &ldquo;I should like to see my granddaughters do
      them!&rdquo; she declared grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for Winterbourne
      remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were
      &ldquo;tremendous flirts.&rdquo; If, therefore, Miss Daisy Miller exceeded the liberal
      margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that anything might
      be expected of her. Winterbourne was impatient to see her again, and he
      was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not appreciate her
      justly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say to
      her about his aunt&rsquo;s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he
      discovered, promptly enough, that with Miss Daisy Miller there was no
      great need of walking on tiptoe. He found her that evening in the garden,
      wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph, and swinging
      to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld. It was ten o&rsquo;clock. He had
      dined with his aunt, had been sitting with her since dinner, and had just
      taken leave of her till the morrow. Miss Daisy Miller seemed very glad to
      see him; she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been all alone?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been walking round with mother. But mother gets tired walking
      round,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she gone to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she doesn&rsquo;t like to go to bed,&rdquo; said the young girl. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t
      sleep&mdash;not three hours. She says she doesn&rsquo;t know how she lives.
      She&rsquo;s dreadfully nervous. I guess she sleeps more than she thinks. She&rsquo;s
      gone somewhere after Randolph; she wants to try to get him to go to bed.
      He doesn&rsquo;t like to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope she will persuade him,&rdquo; observed Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will talk to him all she can; but he doesn&rsquo;t like her to talk to
      him,&rdquo; said Miss Daisy, opening her fan. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to try to get Eugenio
      to talk to him. But he isn&rsquo;t afraid of Eugenio. Eugenio&rsquo;s a splendid
      courier, but he can&rsquo;t make much impression on Randolph! I don&rsquo;t believe
      he&rsquo;ll go to bed before eleven.&rdquo; It appeared that Randolph&rsquo;s vigil was in
      fact triumphantly prolonged, for Winterbourne strolled about with the
      young girl for some time without meeting her mother. &ldquo;I have been looking
      round for that lady you want to introduce me to,&rdquo; his companion resumed.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s your aunt.&rdquo; Then, on Winterbourne&rsquo;s admitting the fact and
      expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it, she said she had
      heard all about Mrs. Costello from the chambermaid. She was very quiet and
      very comme il faut; she wore white puffs; she spoke to no one, and she
      never dined at the table d&rsquo;hote. Every two days she had a headache. &ldquo;I
      think that&rsquo;s a lovely description, headache and all!&rdquo; said Miss Daisy,
      chattering along in her thin, gay voice. &ldquo;I want to know her ever so much.
      I know just what YOUR aunt would be; I know I should like her. She would
      be very exclusive. I like a lady to be exclusive; I&rsquo;m dying to be
      exclusive myself. Well, we ARE exclusive, mother and I. We don&rsquo;t speak to
      everyone&mdash;or they don&rsquo;t speak to us. I suppose it&rsquo;s about the same
      thing. Anyway, I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne was embarrassed. &ldquo;She would be most happy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I
      am afraid those headaches will interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl looked at him through the dusk. &ldquo;But I suppose she doesn&rsquo;t
      have a headache every day,&rdquo; she said sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne was silent a moment. &ldquo;She tells me she does,&rdquo; he answered at
      last, not knowing what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him. Her prettiness was
      still visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous
      fan. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to know me!&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say
      so? You needn&rsquo;t be afraid. I&rsquo;m not afraid!&rdquo; And she gave a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched,
      shocked, mortified by it. &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;she knows
      no one. It&rsquo;s her wretched health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl walked on a few steps, laughing still. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be
      afraid,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why should she want to know me?&rdquo; Then she paused
      again; she was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her was
      the starlit lake. There was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in the
      distance were dimly seen mountain forms. Daisy Miller looked out upon the
      mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh. &ldquo;Gracious! she
      IS exclusive!&rdquo; she said. Winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously
      wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be
      such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her.
      He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for
      consolatory purposes. He felt then, for the instant, quite ready to
      sacrifice his aunt, conversationally; to admit that she was a proud, rude
      woman, and to declare that they needn&rsquo;t mind her. But before he had time
      to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety, the
      young lady, resuming her walk, gave an exclamation in quite another tone.
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s Mother! I guess she hasn&rsquo;t got Randolph to go to bed.&rdquo; The
      figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness,
      and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it is your mother? Can you distinguish her in this thick
      dusk?&rdquo; Winterbourne asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh; &ldquo;I guess I know my own
      mother. And when she has got on my shawl, too! She is always wearing my
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot
      at which she had checked her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid your mother doesn&rsquo;t see you,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;Or
      perhaps,&rdquo; he added, thinking, with Miss Miller, the joke permissible&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps
      she feels guilty about your shawl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a fearful old thing!&rdquo; the young girl replied serenely. &ldquo;I told
      her she could wear it. She won&rsquo;t come here because she sees you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;I had better leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; come on!&rdquo; urged Miss Daisy Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your mother doesn&rsquo;t approve of my walking with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Miller gave him a serious glance. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for me; it&rsquo;s for you&mdash;that
      is, it&rsquo;s for HER. Well, I don&rsquo;t know who it&rsquo;s for! But mother doesn&rsquo;t like
      any of my gentlemen friends. She&rsquo;s right down timid. She always makes a
      fuss if I introduce a gentleman. But I DO introduce them&mdash;almost
      always. If I didn&rsquo;t introduce my gentlemen friends to Mother,&rdquo; the young
      girl added in her little soft, flat monotone, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think I was
      natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To introduce me,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;you must know my name.&rdquo; And he
      proceeded to pronounce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, I can&rsquo;t say all that!&rdquo; said his companion with a laugh. But by
      this time they had come up to Mrs. Miller, who, as they drew near, walked
      to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently at the
      lake and turning her back to them. &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; said the young girl in a tone
      of decision. Upon this the elder lady turned round. &ldquo;Mr. Winterbourne,&rdquo;
       said Miss Daisy Miller, introducing the young man very frankly and
      prettily. &ldquo;Common,&rdquo; she was, as Mrs. Costello had pronounced her; yet it
      was a wonder to Winterbourne that, with her commonness, she had a
      singularly delicate grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye, a very
      exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain amount of
      thin, much frizzled hair. Like her daughter, Mrs. Miller was dressed with
      extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears. So far as
      Winterbourne could observe, she gave him no greeting&mdash;she certainly
      was not looking at him. Daisy was near her, pulling her shawl straight.
      &ldquo;What are you doing, poking round here?&rdquo; this young lady inquired, but by
      no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may
      imply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said her mother, turning toward the lake again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want that shawl!&rdquo; Daisy exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I do!&rdquo; her mother answered with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get Randolph to go to bed?&rdquo; asked the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I couldn&rsquo;t induce him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller very gently. &ldquo;He wants to
      talk to the waiter. He likes to talk to that waiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was telling Mr. Winterbourne,&rdquo; the young girl went on; and to the young
      man&rsquo;s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his
      name all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Winterbourne; &ldquo;I have the pleasure of knowing your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Randolph&rsquo;s mamma was silent; she turned her attention to the lake. But at
      last she spoke. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see how he lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, it isn&rsquo;t so bad as it was at Dover,&rdquo; said Daisy Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what occurred at Dover?&rdquo; Winterbourne asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t go to bed at all. I guess he sat up all night in the public
      parlor. He wasn&rsquo;t in bed at twelve o&rsquo;clock: I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was half-past twelve,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Miller with mild emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he sleep much during the day?&rdquo; Winterbourne demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he doesn&rsquo;t sleep much,&rdquo; Daisy rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would!&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;It seems as if he couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s real tiresome,&rdquo; Daisy pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for some moments, there was silence. &ldquo;Well, Daisy Miller,&rdquo; said the
      elder lady, presently, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want to talk against your
      own brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he IS tiresome, Mother,&rdquo; said Daisy, quite without the asperity of
      a retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only nine,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he wouldn&rsquo;t go to that castle,&rdquo; said the young girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
      there with Mr. Winterbourne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this announcement, very placidly made, Daisy&rsquo;s mamma offered no
      response. Winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the
      projected excursion; but he said to himself that she was a simple, easily
      managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would take the
      edge from her displeasure. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;your daughter has kindly
      allowed me the honor of being her guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s wandering eyes attached themselves, with a sort of appealing
      air, to Daisy, who, however, strolled a few steps farther, gently humming
      to herself. &ldquo;I presume you will go in the cars,&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or in the boat,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mrs. Miller rejoined. &ldquo;I have never been
      to that castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity you shouldn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, beginning to feel
      reassured as to her opposition. And yet he was quite prepared to find
      that, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been thinking ever so much about going,&rdquo; she pursued; &ldquo;but it seems
      as if we couldn&rsquo;t. Of course Daisy&mdash;she wants to go round. But
      there&rsquo;s a lady here&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know her name&mdash;she says she
      shouldn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d want to go to see castles HERE; she should think we&rsquo;d
      want to wait till we got to Italy. It seems as if there would be so many
      there,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Miller with an air of increasing confidence. &ldquo;Of
      course we only want to see the principal ones. We visited several in
      England,&rdquo; she presently added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes! in England there are beautiful castles,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;But
      Chillon here, is very well worth seeing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if Daisy feels up to it&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller, in a tone
      impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise. &ldquo;It seems as
      if there was nothing she wouldn&rsquo;t undertake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think she&rsquo;ll enjoy it!&rdquo; Winterbourne declared. And he desired more
      and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a
      tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along in front of
      them, softly vocalizing. &ldquo;You are not disposed, madam,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;to
      undertake it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy&rsquo;s mother looked at him an instant askance, and then walked forward
      in silence. Then&mdash;&ldquo;I guess she had better go alone,&rdquo; she said simply.
      Winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of
      maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the
      forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of
      the lake. But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very
      distinctly pronounced by Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s unprotected daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Winterbourne!&rdquo; murmured Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle!&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to take me out in a boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annie Miller!&rdquo; exclaimed her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you, madam, to let her go,&rdquo; said Winterbourne ardently; for he had
      never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a
      skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d want to,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;I should think she&rsquo;d
      rather go indoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Winterbourne wants to take me,&rdquo; Daisy declared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so
      awfully devoted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated the elder lady again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t spoken to me for half an hour,&rdquo; her daughter went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother,&rdquo;
       said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want you to take me out in a boat!&rdquo; Daisy repeated. They had all
      stopped, and she had turned round and was looking at Winterbourne. Her
      face wore a charming smile, her pretty eyes were gleaming, she was
      swinging her great fan about. No; it&rsquo;s impossible to be prettier than
      that, thought Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place,&rdquo; he said,
      pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake. &ldquo;If
      you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy stood there smiling; she threw back her head and gave a little,
      light laugh. &ldquo;I like a gentleman to be formal!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it&rsquo;s a formal offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was bound I would make you say something,&rdquo; Daisy went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s not very difficult,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;But I am afraid
      you are chaffing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, sir,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Miller very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, then, let me give you a row,&rdquo; he said to the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite lovely, the way you say that!&rdquo; cried Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be still more lovely to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it would be lovely!&rdquo; said Daisy. But she made no movement to
      accompany him; she only stood there laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you had better find out what time it is,&rdquo; interposed her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is eleven o&rsquo;clock, madam,&rdquo; said a voice, with a foreign accent, out of
      the neighboring darkness; and Winterbourne, turning, perceived the florid
      personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. He had apparently
      just approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eugenio,&rdquo; said Daisy, &ldquo;I am going out in a boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenio bowed. &ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with Mr. Winterbourne&mdash;this very minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell her she can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller to the courier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle,&rdquo; Eugenio
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with
      her courier; but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s proper!&rdquo; Daisy exclaimed. &ldquo;Eugenio doesn&rsquo;t
      think anything&rsquo;s proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does mademoiselle propose to go alone?&rdquo; asked Eugenio of Mrs. Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; with this gentleman!&rdquo; answered Daisy&rsquo;s mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courier looked for a moment at Winterbourne&mdash;the latter thought
      he was smiling&mdash;and then, solemnly, with a bow, &ldquo;As mademoiselle
      pleases!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hoped you would make a fuss!&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself shall make a fuss if you don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want&mdash;a little fuss!&rdquo; And the young girl began to laugh
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Randolph has gone to bed!&rdquo; the courier announced frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Daisy; now we can go!&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy turned away from Winterbourne, looking at him, smiling and fanning
      herself. &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I hope you are disappointed, or
      disgusted, or something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, taking the hand she offered him. &ldquo;I am puzzled,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope it won&rsquo;t keep you awake!&rdquo; she said very smartly; and, under
      the escort of the privileged Eugenio, the two ladies passed toward the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne stood looking after them; he was indeed puzzled. He lingered
      beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the mystery of the
      young girl&rsquo;s sudden familiarities and caprices. But the only very definite
      conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly &ldquo;going off&rdquo; with
      her somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon. He
      waited for her in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the
      servants, the foreign tourists, were lounging about and staring. It was
      not the place he should have chosen, but she had appointed it. She came
      tripping downstairs, buttoning her long gloves, squeezing her folded
      parasol against her pretty figure, dressed in the perfection of a soberly
      elegant traveling costume. Winterbourne was a man of imagination and, as
      our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he looked at her dress and, on
      the great staircase, her little rapid, confiding step, he felt as if there
      were something romantic going forward. He could have believed he was going
      to elope with her. He passed out with her among all the idle people that
      were assembled there; they were all looking at her very hard; she had
      begun to chatter as soon as she joined him. Winterbourne&rsquo;s preference had
      been that they should be conveyed to Chillon in a carriage; but she
      expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer; she declared that she
      had a passion for steamboats. There was always such a lovely breeze upon
      the water, and you saw such lots of people. The sail was not long, but
      Winterbourne&rsquo;s companion found time to say a great many things. To the
      young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapade&mdash;an
      adventure&mdash;that, even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom, he
      had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way. But it must
      be confessed that, in this particular, he was disappointed. Daisy Miller
      was extremely animated, she was in charming spirits; but she was
      apparently not at all excited; she was not fluttered; she avoided neither
      his eyes nor those of anyone else; she blushed neither when she looked at
      him nor when she felt that people were looking at her. People continued to
      look at her a great deal, and Winterbourne took much satisfaction in his
      pretty companion&rsquo;s distinguished air. He had been a little afraid that she
      would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about
      the boat a good deal. But he quite forgot his fears; he sat smiling, with
      his eyes upon her face, while, without moving from her place, she
      delivered herself of a great number of original reflections. It was the
      most charming garrulity he had ever heard. He had assented to the idea
      that she was &ldquo;common&rdquo;; but was she so, after all, or was he simply getting
      used to her commonness? Her conversation was chiefly of what
      metaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a
      subjective turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on EARTH are you so grave about?&rdquo; she suddenly demanded, fixing her
      agreeable eyes upon Winterbourne&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I grave?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you were taking me to a funeral. If that&rsquo;s a grin, your
      ears are very near together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do, and I&rsquo;ll carry round your hat. It will pay the expenses of our
      journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was better pleased in my life,&rdquo; murmured Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh. &ldquo;I like to
      make you say those things! You&rsquo;re a queer mixture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the castle, after they had landed, the subjective element decidedly
      prevailed. Daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers, rustled her skirts in
      the corkscrew staircases, flirted back with a pretty little cry and a
      shudder from the edge of the oubliettes, and turned a singularly
      well-shaped ear to everything that Winterbourne told her about the place.
      But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the
      dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon her. They
      had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other
      companionship than that of the custodian; and Winterbourne arranged with
      this functionary that they should not be hurried&mdash;that they should
      linger and pause wherever they chose. The custodian interpreted the
      bargain generously&mdash;Winterbourne, on his side, had been generous&mdash;and
      ended by leaving them quite to themselves. Miss Miller&rsquo;s observations were
      not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything she wanted to say she
      was sure to find a pretext. She found a great many pretexts in the rugged
      embrasures of Chillon for asking Winterbourne sudden questions about
      himself&mdash;his family, his previous history, his tastes, his habits,
      his intentions&mdash;and for supplying information upon corresponding
      points in her own personality. Of her own tastes, habits, and intentions
      Miss Miller was prepared to give the most definite, and indeed the most
      favorable account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you know enough!&rdquo; she said to her companion, after he had
      told her the history of the unhappy Bonivard. &ldquo;I never saw a man that knew
      so much!&rdquo; The history of Bonivard had evidently, as they say, gone into
      one ear and out of the other. But Daisy went on to say that she wished
      Winterbourne would travel with them and &ldquo;go round&rdquo; with them; they might
      know something, in that case. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to come and teach Randolph?&rdquo;
       she asked. Winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so
      much, but that he had unfortunately other occupations. &ldquo;Other occupations?
      I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; said Miss Daisy. &ldquo;What do you mean? You are not in
      business.&rdquo; The young man admitted that he was not in business; but he had
      engagements which, even within a day or two, would force him to go back to
      Geneva. &ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; and she began to
      talk about something else. But a few moments later, when he was pointing
      out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace, she broke out
      irrelevantly, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you are going back to Geneva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Winterbourne,&rdquo; said Daisy, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re horrid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say such dreadful things!&rdquo; said Winterbourne&mdash;&ldquo;just at the
      last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last!&rdquo; cried the young girl; &ldquo;I call it the first. I have half a mind
      to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone.&rdquo; And for the
      next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid. Poor Winterbourne
      was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be
      so agitated by the announcement of his movements. His companion, after
      this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of Chillon or the
      beauties of the lake; she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in
      Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he
      was hurrying back to see. How did Miss Daisy Miller know that there was a
      charmer in Geneva? Winterbourne, who denied the existence of such a
      person, was quite unable to discover, and he was divided between amazement
      at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her
      persiflage. She seemed to him, in all this, an extraordinary mixture of
      innocence and crudity. &ldquo;Does she never allow you more than three days at a
      time?&rdquo; asked Daisy ironically. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she give you a vacation in summer?
      There&rsquo;s no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere
      at this season. I suppose, if you stay another day, she&rsquo;ll come after you
      in the boat. Do wait over till Friday, and I will go down to the landing
      to see her arrive!&rdquo; Winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel
      disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked. If he had
      missed the personal accent, the personal accent was now making its
      appearance. It sounded very distinctly, at last, in her telling him she
      would stop &ldquo;teasing&rdquo; him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to
      Rome in the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a difficult promise to make,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;My aunt has
      taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me to come
      and see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to come for your aunt,&rdquo; said Daisy; &ldquo;I want you to come
      for me.&rdquo; And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to
      hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. He declared that, at any rate,
      he would certainly come. After this Daisy stopped teasing. Winterbourne
      took a carriage, and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk; the young girl
      was very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Winterbourne mentioned to Mrs. Costello that he had spent
      the afternoon at Chillon with Miss Daisy Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Americans&mdash;of the courier?&rdquo; asked this lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, happily,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;the courier stayed at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went with you all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;is the young person whom you wanted me to know!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      PART II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Winterbourne, who had returned to Geneva the day after his excursion to
      Chillon, went to Rome toward the end of January. His aunt had been
      established there for several weeks, and he had received a couple of
      letters from her. &ldquo;Those people you were so devoted to last summer at
      Vevey have turned up here, courier and all,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;They seem to have
      made several acquaintances, but the courier continues to be the most
      intime. The young lady, however, is also very intimate with some
      third-rate Italians, with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much
      talk. Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez&rsquo;s&mdash;Paule Mere&mdash;and
      don&rsquo;t come later than the 23rd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the natural course of events, Winterbourne, on arriving in Rome, would
      presently have ascertained Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s address at the American banker&rsquo;s
      and have gone to pay his compliments to Miss Daisy. &ldquo;After what happened
      at Vevey, I think I may certainly call upon them,&rdquo; he said to Mrs.
      Costello.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, after what happens&mdash;at Vevey and everywhere&mdash;you desire to
      keep up the acquaintance, you are very welcome. Of course a man may know
      everyone. Men are welcome to the privilege!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray what is it that happens&mdash;here, for instance?&rdquo; Winterbourne
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl goes about alone with her foreigners. As to what happens
      further, you must apply elsewhere for information. She has picked up half
      a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters, and she takes them about to
      people&rsquo;s houses. When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman
      with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea. They are very dreadful people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne meditated a moment. &ldquo;They are very ignorant&mdash;very
      innocent only. Depend upon it they are not bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are hopelessly vulgar,&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello. &ldquo;Whether or no being
      hopelessly vulgar is being &lsquo;bad&rsquo; is a question for the metaphysicians.
      They are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life that
      is quite enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news that Daisy Miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful
      mustaches checked Winterbourne&rsquo;s impulse to go straightway to see her. He
      had, perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he had made an
      ineffaceable impression upon her heart, but he was annoyed at hearing of a
      state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately
      flitted in and out of his own meditations; the image of a very pretty girl
      looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently when Mr.
      Winterbourne would arrive. If, however, he determined to wait a little
      before reminding Miss Miller of his claims to her consideration, he went
      very soon to call upon two or three other friends. One of these friends
      was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva, where she
      had placed her children at school. She was a very accomplished woman, and
      she lived in the Via Gregoriana. Winterbourne found her in a little
      crimson drawing room on a third floor; the room was filled with southern
      sunshine. He had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in,
      announcing &ldquo;Madame Mila!&rdquo; This announcement was presently followed by the
      entrance of little Randolph Miller, who stopped in the middle of the room
      and stood staring at Winterbourne. An instant later his pretty sister
      crossed the threshold; and then, after a considerable interval, Mrs.
      Miller slowly advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you!&rdquo; said Randolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you know a great many things,&rdquo; exclaimed Winterbourne, taking
      him by the hand. &ldquo;How is your education coming on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess, but when
      she heard Winterbourne&rsquo;s voice she quickly turned her head. &ldquo;Well, I
      declare!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I should come, you know,&rdquo; Winterbourne rejoined, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Miss Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you,&rdquo; laughed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have come to see me!&rdquo; said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I arrived only yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that!&rdquo; the young girl declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady
      evaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a bigger place than this,&rdquo; said Randolph. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all gold on the
      walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Miller turned uneasily in her chair. &ldquo;I told you if I were to bring
      you, you would say something!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told YOU!&rdquo; Randolph exclaimed. &ldquo;I tell YOU, sir!&rdquo; he added jocosely,
      giving Winterbourne a thump on the knee. &ldquo;It IS bigger, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess;
      Winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother. &ldquo;I
      hope you have been well since we parted at Vevey,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Miller now certainly looked at him&mdash;at his chin. &ldquo;Not very well,
      sir,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the dyspepsia,&rdquo; said Randolph. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it too. Father&rsquo;s got
      it. I&rsquo;ve got it most!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This announcement, instead of embarrassing Mrs. Miller, seemed to relieve
      her. &ldquo;I suffer from the liver,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s this climate; it&rsquo;s
      less bracing than Schenectady, especially in the winter season. I don&rsquo;t
      know whether you know we reside at Schenectady. I was saying to Daisy that
      I certainly hadn&rsquo;t found any one like Dr. Davis, and I didn&rsquo;t believe I
      should. Oh, at Schenectady he stands first; they think everything of him.
      He has so much to do, and yet there was nothing he wouldn&rsquo;t do for me. He
      said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia, but he was bound to cure it.
      I&rsquo;m sure there was nothing he wouldn&rsquo;t try. He was just going to try
      something new when we came off. Mr. Miller wanted Daisy to see Europe for
      herself. But I wrote to Mr. Miller that it seems as if I couldn&rsquo;t get on
      without Dr. Davis. At Schenectady he stands at the very top; and there&rsquo;s a
      great deal of sickness there, too. It affects my sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with Dr. Davis&rsquo;s
      patient, during which Daisy chattered unremittingly to her own companion.
      The young man asked Mrs. Miller how she was pleased with Rome. &ldquo;Well, I
      must say I am disappointed,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We had heard so much about it;
      I suppose we had heard too much. But we couldn&rsquo;t help that. We had been
      led to expect something different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it,&rdquo; said
      Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate it worse and worse every day!&rdquo; cried Randolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like the infant Hannibal,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Randolph declared at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not much like an infant,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;But we have seen
      places,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that I should put a long way before Rome.&rdquo; And in
      reply to Winterbourne&rsquo;s interrogation, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Zurich,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;I
      think Zurich is lovely; and we hadn&rsquo;t heard half so much about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best place we&rsquo;ve seen is the City of Richmond!&rdquo; said Randolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means the ship,&rdquo; his mother explained. &ldquo;We crossed in that ship.
      Randolph had a good time on the City of Richmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best place I&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; the child repeated. &ldquo;Only it was turned
      the wrong way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to turn the right way some time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller with a
      little laugh. Winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at least
      found some gratification in Rome, and she declared that Daisy was quite
      carried away. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on account of the society&mdash;the society&rsquo;s
      splendid. She goes round everywhere; she has made a great number of
      acquaintances. Of course she goes round more than I do. I must say they
      have been very sociable; they have taken her right in. And then she knows
      a great many gentlemen. Oh, she thinks there&rsquo;s nothing like Rome. Of
      course, it&rsquo;s a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty
      of gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Daisy had turned her attention again to Winterbourne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been telling Mrs. Walker how mean you were!&rdquo; the young girl announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the evidence you have offered?&rdquo; asked Winterbourne, rather
      annoyed at Miss Miller&rsquo;s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer
      who on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at
      Florence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. He
      remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American women&mdash;the
      pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiom&mdash;were at once the
      most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of
      indebtedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you were awfully mean at Vevey,&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do
      anything. You wouldn&rsquo;t stay there when I asked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest young lady,&rdquo; cried Winterbourne, with eloquence, &ldquo;have I come
      all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just hear him say that!&rdquo; said Daisy to her hostess, giving a twist to a
      bow on this lady&rsquo;s dress. &ldquo;Did you ever hear anything so quaint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So quaint, my dear?&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Walker in the tone of a partisan of
      Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Daisy, fingering Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s ribbons. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Walker, I want to tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother-r,&rdquo; interposed Randolph, with his rough ends to his words, &ldquo;I tell
      you you&rsquo;ve got to go. Eugenio&rsquo;ll raise&mdash;something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of Eugenio,&rdquo; said Daisy with a toss of her head. &ldquo;Look
      here, Mrs. Walker,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you know I&rsquo;m coming to your party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lovely dress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to ask a favor&mdash;permission to bring a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happy to see any of your friends,&rdquo; said Mrs. Walker, turning
      with a smile to Mrs. Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are not my friends,&rdquo; answered Daisy&rsquo;s mamma, smiling shyly in
      her own fashion. &ldquo;I never spoke to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an intimate friend of mine&mdash;Mr. Giovanelli,&rdquo; said Daisy without
      a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at Winterbourne.
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to see Mr. Giovanelli,&rdquo; she then said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Italian,&rdquo; Daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
      great friend of mine; he&rsquo;s the handsomest man in the world&mdash;except
      Mr. Winterbourne! He knows plenty of Italians, but he wants to know some
      Americans. He thinks ever so much of Americans. He&rsquo;s tremendously clever.
      He&rsquo;s perfectly lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to Mrs.
      Walker&rsquo;s party, and then Mrs. Miller prepared to take her leave. &ldquo;I guess
      we&rsquo;ll go back to the hotel,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go back to the hotel, Mother, but I&rsquo;m going to take a walk,&rdquo; said
      Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to walk with Mr. Giovanelli,&rdquo; Randolph proclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the Pincio,&rdquo; said Daisy, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, my dear&mdash;at this hour?&rdquo; Mrs. Walker asked. The afternoon was
      drawing to a close&mdash;it was the hour for the throng of carriages and
      of contemplative pedestrians. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s safe, my dear,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; subjoined Mrs. Miller. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get the fever, as sure as
      you live. Remember what Dr. Davis told you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her some medicine before she goes,&rdquo; said Randolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company had risen to its feet; Daisy, still showing her pretty teeth,
      bent over and kissed her hostess. &ldquo;Mrs. Walker, you are too perfect,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going alone; I am going to meet a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend won&rsquo;t keep you from getting the fever,&rdquo; Mrs. Miller observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Mr. Giovanelli?&rdquo; asked the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention
      quickened. She stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; she
      glanced at Winterbourne. Then, while she glanced and smiled, she answered,
      without a shade of hesitation, &ldquo;Mr. Giovanelli&mdash;the beautiful
      Giovanelli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young friend,&rdquo; said Mrs. Walker, taking her hand pleadingly,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he speaks English,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious me!&rdquo; Daisy exclaimed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t to do anything improper. There&rsquo;s
      an easy way to settle it.&rdquo; She continued to glance at Winterbourne. &ldquo;The
      Pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if Mr. Winterbourne were as
      polite as he pretends, he would offer to walk with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne&rsquo;s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl
      gave him gracious leave to accompany her. They passed downstairs before
      her mother, and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s carriage
      drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at
      Vevey seated within. &ldquo;Goodbye, Eugenio!&rdquo; cried Daisy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a
      walk.&rdquo; The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the
      other end of the Pincian Hill is, in fact, rapidly traversed. As the day
      was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and
      loungers numerous, the young Americans found their progress much delayed.
      This fact was highly agreeable to Winterbourne, in spite of his
      consciousness of his singular situation. The slow-moving, idly gazing
      Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young
      foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what
      on earth had been in Daisy&rsquo;s mind when she proposed to expose herself,
      unattended, to its appreciation. His own mission, to her sense,
      apparently, was to consign her to the hands of Mr. Giovanelli; but
      Winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified, resolved that he would do no
      such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you been to see me?&rdquo; asked Daisy. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out of
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of
      the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!&rdquo; cried
      the young girl with her little laugh. &ldquo;I suppose you were asleep. You have
      had time to go to see Mrs. Walker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew Mrs. Walker&mdash;&rdquo; Winterbourne began to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where you knew her. You knew her at Geneva. She told me so. Well,
      you knew me at Vevey. That&rsquo;s just as good. So you ought to have come.&rdquo; She
      asked him no other question than this; she began to prattle about her own
      affairs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got splendid rooms at the hotel; Eugenio says they&rsquo;re the
      best rooms in Rome. We are going to stay all winter, if we don&rsquo;t die of
      the fever; and I guess we&rsquo;ll stay then. It&rsquo;s a great deal nicer than I
      thought; I thought it would be fearfully quiet; I was sure it would be
      awfully poky. I was sure we should be going round all the time with one of
      those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things. But we
      only had about a week of that, and now I&rsquo;m enjoying myself. I know ever so
      many people, and they are all so charming. The society&rsquo;s extremely select.
      There are all kinds&mdash;English, and Germans, and Italians. I think I
      like the English best. I like their style of conversation. But there are
      some lovely Americans. I never saw anything so hospitable. There&rsquo;s
      something or other every day. There&rsquo;s not much dancing; but I must say I
      never thought dancing was everything. I was always fond of conversation. I
      guess I shall have plenty at Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s, her rooms are so small.&rdquo; When
      they had passed the gate of the Pincian Gardens, Miss Miller began to
      wonder where Mr. Giovanelli might be. &ldquo;We had better go straight to that
      place in front,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where you look at the view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly shall not help you to find him,&rdquo; Winterbourne declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall find him without you,&rdquo; cried Miss Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly won&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo; cried Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into her little laugh. &ldquo;Are you afraid you&rsquo;ll get lost&mdash;or
      run over? But there&rsquo;s Giovanelli, leaning against that tree. He&rsquo;s staring
      at the women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded
      arms nursing his cane. He had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a
      glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole. Winterbourne looked at
      him a moment and then said, &ldquo;Do you mean to speak to that man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I mean to speak to him? Why, you don&rsquo;t suppose I mean to communicate
      by signs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray understand, then,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;that I intend to remain with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy stopped and looked at him, without a sign of troubled consciousness
      in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her
      happy dimples. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a cool one!&rdquo; thought the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way you say that,&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too imperious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon if I say it wrong. The main point is to give you an
      idea of my meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl looked at him more gravely, but with eyes that were
      prettier than ever. &ldquo;I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me, or
      to interfere with anything I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have made a mistake,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;You should
      sometimes listen to a gentleman&mdash;the right one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy began to laugh again. &ldquo;I do nothing but listen to gentlemen!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Tell me if Mr. Giovanelli is the right one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two
      friends, and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity. He
      bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latter&rsquo;s companion; he had a
      brilliant smile, an intelligent eye; Winterbourne thought him not a
      bad-looking fellow. But he nevertheless said to Daisy, &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not the
      right one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions; she
      mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other. She strolled
      alone with one of them on each side of her; Mr. Giovanelli, who spoke
      English very cleverly&mdash;Winterbourne afterward learned that he had
      practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses&mdash;addressed
      her a great deal of very polite nonsense; he was extremely urbane, and the
      young American, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of
      Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in
      proportion as they are more acutely disappointed. Giovanelli, of course,
      had counted upon something more intimate; he had not bargained for a party
      of three. But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested
      far-stretching intentions. Winterbourne flattered himself that he had
      taken his measure. &ldquo;He is not a gentleman,&rdquo; said the young American; &ldquo;he
      is only a clever imitation of one. He is a music master, or a
      penny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist. D__n his good looks!&rdquo; Mr.
      Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face; but Winterbourne felt a
      superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman&rsquo;s not knowing
      the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one. Giovanelli
      chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable. It was true
      that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo;
       Winterbourne said to himself, &ldquo;a nice girl ought to know!&rdquo; And then he
      came back to the question whether this was, in fact, a nice girl. Would a
      nice girl, even allowing for her being a little American flirt, make a
      rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner? The rendezvous in this
      case, indeed, had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of
      Rome, but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these
      circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism? Singular though it may seem,
      Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl, in joining her amoroso, should
      not appear more impatient of his own company, and he was vexed because of
      his inclination. It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly
      well-conducted young lady; she was wanting in a certain indispensable
      delicacy. It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat
      her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers
      &ldquo;lawless passions.&rdquo; That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would
      help him to think more lightly of her, and to be able to think more
      lightly of her would make her much less perplexing. But Daisy, on this
      occasion, continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of
      audacity and innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two
      cavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it seemed
      to Winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of Mr. Giovanelli, when a carriage
      that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path.
      At the same moment Winterbourne perceived that his friend Mrs. Walker&mdash;the
      lady whose house he had lately left&mdash;was seated in the vehicle and
      was beckoning to him. Leaving Miss Miller&rsquo;s side, he hastened to obey her
      summons. Mrs. Walker was flushed; she wore an excited air. &ldquo;It is really
      too dreadful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That girl must not do this sort of thing. She
      must not walk here with you two men. Fifty people have noticed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a pity to make too much
      fuss about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to let the girl ruin herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very innocent,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very crazy!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Walker. &ldquo;Did you ever see anything so
      imbecile as her mother? After you had all left me just now, I could not
      sit still for thinking of it. It seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt
      to save her. I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here as
      quickly as possible. Thank Heaven I have found you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you propose to do with us?&rdquo; asked Winterbourne, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ask her to get in, to drive her about here for half an hour, so that
      the world may see she is not running absolutely wild, and then to take her
      safely home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a very happy thought,&rdquo; said Winterbourne; &ldquo;but you can
      try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Walker tried. The young man went in pursuit of Miss Miller, who had
      simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone
      her way with her companion. Daisy, on learning that Mrs. Walker wished to
      speak to her, retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with Mr.
      Giovanelli at her side. She declared that she was delighted to have a
      chance to present this gentleman to Mrs. Walker. She immediately achieved
      the introduction, and declared that she had never in her life seen
      anything so lovely as Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s carriage rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you admire it,&rdquo; said this lady, smiling sweetly. &ldquo;Will you get
      in and let me put it over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thank you,&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;I shall admire it much more as I see you
      driving round with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do get in and drive with me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be charming, but it&rsquo;s so enchanting just as I am!&rdquo; and Daisy
      gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be enchanting, dear child, but it is not the custom here,&rdquo; urged
      Mrs. Walker, leaning forward in her victoria, with her hands devoutly
      clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ought to be, then!&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t walk I should
      expire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should walk with your mother, dear,&rdquo; cried the lady from Geneva,
      losing patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my mother dear!&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl. Winterbourne saw that she
      scented interference. &ldquo;My mother never walked ten steps in her life. And
      then, you know,&rdquo; she added with a laugh, &ldquo;I am more than five years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are old enough to be more reasonable. You are old enough, dear Miss
      Miller, to be talked about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy looked at Mrs. Walker, smiling intensely. &ldquo;Talked about? What do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into my carriage, and I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside
      her to the other. Mr. Giovanelli was bowing to and fro, rubbing down his
      gloves and laughing very agreeably; Winterbourne thought it a most
      unpleasant scene. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want to know what you mean,&rdquo; said Daisy
      presently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne wished that Mrs. Walker would tuck in her carriage rug and
      drive away, but this lady did not enjoy being defied, as she afterward
      told him. &ldquo;Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl?&rdquo; she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Daisy. She looked again at Mr. Giovanelli, then she
      turned to Winterbourne. There was a little pink flush in her cheek; she
      was tremendously pretty. &ldquo;Does Mr. Winterbourne think,&rdquo; she asked slowly,
      smiling, throwing back her head, and glancing at him from head to foot,
      &ldquo;that, to save my reputation, I ought to get into the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. It seemed so
      strange to hear her speak that way of her &ldquo;reputation.&rdquo; But he himself, in
      fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. The finest gallantry, here,
      was simply to tell her the truth; and the truth, for Winterbourne, as the
      few indications I have been able to give have made him known to the
      reader, was that Daisy Miller should take Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s advice. He looked
      at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, &ldquo;I think you
      should get into the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy gave a violent laugh. &ldquo;I never heard anything so stiff! If this is
      improper, Mrs. Walker,&rdquo; she pursued, &ldquo;then I am all improper, and you must
      give me up. Goodbye; I hope you&rsquo;ll have a lovely ride!&rdquo; and, with Mr.
      Giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Walker sat looking after her, and there were tears in Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s
      eyes. &ldquo;Get in here, sir,&rdquo; she said to Winterbourne, indicating the place
      beside her. The young man answered that he felt bound to accompany Miss
      Miller, whereupon Mrs. Walker declared that if he refused her this favor
      she would never speak to him again. She was evidently in earnest.
      Winterbourne overtook Daisy and her companion, and, offering the young
      girl his hand, told her that Mrs. Walker had made an imperious claim upon
      his society. He expected that in answer she would say something rather
      free, something to commit herself still further to that &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo;
       from which Mrs. Walker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her. But
      she only shook his hand, hardly looking at him, while Mr. Giovanelli bade
      him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in
      Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s victoria. &ldquo;That was not clever of you,&rdquo; he said candidly,
      while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a case,&rdquo; his companion answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be clever; I
      wish to be EARNEST!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your earnestness has only offended her and put her off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has happened very well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Walker. &ldquo;If she is so perfectly
      determined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better; one
      can act accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect she meant no harm,&rdquo; Winterbourne rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought a month ago. But she has been going too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything that is not done here. Flirting with any man she could pick
      up; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians; dancing all the evening
      with the same partners; receiving visits at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night. Her
      mother goes away when visitors come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her brother,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, laughing, &ldquo;sits up till midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be edified by what he sees. I&rsquo;m told that at their hotel everyone
      is talking about her, and that a smile goes round among all the servants
      when a gentleman comes and asks for Miss Miller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The servants be hanged!&rdquo; said Winterbourne angrily. &ldquo;The poor girl&rsquo;s only
      fault,&rdquo; he presently added, &ldquo;is that she is very uncultivated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is naturally indelicate,&rdquo; Mrs. Walker declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that example this morning. How long had you known her at Vevey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy, then, her making it a personal matter that you should have left
      the place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne was silent for some moments; then he said, &ldquo;I suspect, Mrs.
      Walker, that you and I have lived too long at Geneva!&rdquo; And he added a
      request that she should inform him with what particular design she had
      made him enter her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to beg you to cease your relations with Miss Miller&mdash;not to
      flirt with her&mdash;to give her no further opportunity to expose herself&mdash;to
      let her alone, in short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Winterbourne. &ldquo;I like her extremely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more reason that you shouldn&rsquo;t help her to make a scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There certainly will be in the way she takes them. But I have said what I
      had on my conscience,&rdquo; Mrs. Walker pursued. &ldquo;If you wish to rejoin the
      young lady I will put you down. Here, by the way, you have a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that overhangs
      the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese. It is
      bordered by a large parapet, near which there are several seats. One of
      the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady, toward
      whom Mrs. Walker gave a toss of her head. At the same moment these persons
      rose and walked toward the parapet. Winterbourne had asked the coachman to
      stop; he now descended from the carriage. His companion looked at him a
      moment in silence; then, while he raised his hat, she drove majestically
      away. Winterbourne stood there; he had turned his eyes toward Daisy and
      her cavalier. They evidently saw no one; they were too deeply occupied
      with each other. When they reached the low garden wall, they stood a
      moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the Villa
      Borghese; then Giovanelli seated himself, familiarly, upon the broad ledge
      of the wall. The western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant
      shaft through a couple of cloud bars, whereupon Daisy&rsquo;s companion took her
      parasol out of her hands and opened it. She came a little nearer, and he
      held the parasol over her; then, still holding it, he let it rest upon her
      shoulder, so that both of their heads were hidden from Winterbourne. This
      young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk. But he walked&mdash;not
      toward the couple with the parasol; toward the residence of his aunt, Mrs.
      Costello.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among
      the servants when he, at least, asked for Mrs. Miller at her hotel. This
      lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on the next day
      after, repeating his visit, Winterbourne again had the misfortune not to
      find them. Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s party took place on the evening of the third day,
      and, in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess,
      Winterbourne was among the guests. Mrs. Walker was one of those American
      ladies who, while residing abroad, make a point, in their own phrase, of
      studying European society, and she had on this occasion collected several
      specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve, as it were, as
      textbooks. When Winterbourne arrived, Daisy Miller was not there, but in a
      few moments he saw her mother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. Mrs.
      Miller&rsquo;s hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than
      ever. As she approached Mrs. Walker, Winterbourne also drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve come all alone,&rdquo; said poor Mrs. Miller. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so frightened;
      I don&rsquo;t know what to do. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever been to a party
      alone, especially in this country. I wanted to bring Randolph or Eugenio,
      or someone, but Daisy just pushed me off by myself. I ain&rsquo;t used to going
      round alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society?&rdquo; demanded
      Mrs. Walker impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Daisy&rsquo;s all dressed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller with that accent of the
      dispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historian with which she always
      recorded the current incidents of her daughter&rsquo;s career. &ldquo;She got dressed
      on purpose before dinner. But she&rsquo;s got a friend of hers there; that
      gentleman&mdash;the Italian&mdash;that she wanted to bring. They&rsquo;ve got
      going at the piano; it seems as if they couldn&rsquo;t leave off. Mr. Giovanelli
      sings splendidly. But I guess they&rsquo;ll come before very long,&rdquo; concluded
      Mrs. Miller hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry she should come in that way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before
      dinner if she was going to wait three hours,&rdquo; responded Daisy&rsquo;s mamma. &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round
      with Mr. Giovanelli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most horrible!&rdquo; said Mrs. Walker, turning away and addressing
      herself to Winterbourne. &ldquo;Elle s&rsquo;affiche. It&rsquo;s her revenge for my having
      ventured to remonstrate with her. When she comes, I shall not speak to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy came after eleven o&rsquo;clock; but she was not, on such an occasion, a
      young lady to wait to be spoken to. She rustled forward in radiant
      loveliness, smiling and chattering, carrying a large bouquet, and attended
      by Mr. Giovanelli. Everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her.
      She came straight to Mrs. Walker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you thought I never was
      coming, so I sent mother off to tell you. I wanted to make Mr. Giovanelli
      practice some things before he came; you know he sings beautifully, and I
      want you to ask him to sing. This is Mr. Giovanelli; you know I introduced
      him to you; he&rsquo;s got the most lovely voice, and he knows the most charming
      set of songs. I made him go over them this evening on purpose; we had the
      greatest time at the hotel.&rdquo; Of all this Daisy delivered herself with the
      sweetest, brightest audibleness, looking now at her hostess and now round
      the room, while she gave a series of little pats, round her shoulders, to
      the edges of her dress. &ldquo;Is there anyone I know?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think every one knows you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Walker pregnantly, and she gave a
      very cursory greeting to Mr. Giovanelli. This gentleman bore himself
      gallantly. He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth; he curled his
      mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a
      handsome Italian at an evening party. He sang very prettily half a dozen
      songs, though Mrs. Walker afterward declared that she had been quite
      unable to find out who asked him. It was apparently not Daisy who had
      given him his orders. Daisy sat at a distance from the piano, and though
      she had publicly, as it were, professed a high admiration for his singing,
      talked, not inaudibly, while it was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity these rooms are so small; we can&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; she said to
      Winterbourne, as if she had seen him five minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sorry we can&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; Winterbourne answered; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t dance; you&rsquo;re too stiff,&rdquo; said Miss Daisy. &ldquo;I hope
      you enjoyed your drive with Mrs. Walker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it; I preferred walking with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We paired off: that was much better,&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;But did you ever hear
      anything so cool as Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s wanting me to get into her carriage and
      drop poor Mr. Giovanelli, and under the pretext that it was proper? People
      have different ideas! It would have been most unkind; he had been talking
      about that walk for ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should not have talked about it at all,&rdquo; said Winterbourne; &ldquo;he would
      never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the
      streets with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the streets?&rdquo; cried Daisy with her pretty stare. &ldquo;Where, then,
      would he have proposed to her to walk? The Pincio is not the streets,
      either; and I, thank goodness, am not a young lady of this country. The
      young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it, so far as
      I can learn; I don&rsquo;t see why I should change my habits for THEM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt,&rdquo; said Winterbourne gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they are,&rdquo; she cried, giving him her little smiling stare
      again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fearful, frightful flirt! Did you ever hear of a nice girl
      that was not? But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very nice girl; but I wish you would flirt with me, and me
      only,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! thank you&mdash;thank you very much; you are the last man I should
      think of flirting with. As I have had the pleasure of informing you, you
      are too stiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that too often,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy gave a delighted laugh. &ldquo;If I could have the sweet hope of making
      you angry, I should say it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that; when I am angry I&rsquo;m stiffer than ever. But if you won&rsquo;t
      flirt with me, do cease, at least, to flirt with your friend at the piano;
      they don&rsquo;t understand that sort of thing here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought they understood nothing else!&rdquo; exclaimed Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in young unmarried women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old
      married ones,&rdquo; Daisy declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;when you deal with natives you must go by the
      custom of the place. Flirting is a purely American custom; it doesn&rsquo;t
      exist here. So when you show yourself in public with Mr. Giovanelli, and
      without your mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious! poor Mother!&rdquo; interposed Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though you may be flirting, Mr. Giovanelli is not; he means something
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t preaching, at any rate,&rdquo; said Daisy with vivacity. &ldquo;And if you
      want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good
      friends for that: we are very intimate friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; rejoined Winterbourne, &ldquo;if you are in love with each other, it is
      another affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no
      expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation; but she immediately got
      up, blushing visibly, and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little
      American flirts were the queerest creatures in the world. &ldquo;Mr. Giovanelli,
      at least,&rdquo; she said, giving her interlocutor a single glance, &ldquo;never says
      such very disagreeable things to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne was bewildered; he stood, staring. Mr. Giovanelli had
      finished singing. He left the piano and came over to Daisy. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
      come into the other room and have some tea?&rdquo; he asked, bending before her
      with his ornamental smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy turned to Winterbourne, beginning to smile again. He was still more
      perplexed, for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear, though it
      seemed to prove, indeed, that she had a sweetness and softness that
      reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses. &ldquo;It has never occurred
      to Mr. Winterbourne to offer me any tea,&rdquo; she said with her little
      tormenting manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have offered you advice,&rdquo; Winterbourne rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer weak tea!&rdquo; cried Daisy, and she went off with the brilliant
      Giovanelli. She sat with him in the adjoining room, in the embrasure of
      the window, for the rest of the evening. There was an interesting
      performance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed to
      it. When Daisy came to take leave of Mrs. Walker, this lady
      conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the
      moment of the young girl&rsquo;s arrival. She turned her back straight upon Miss
      Miller and left her to depart with what grace she might. Winterbourne was
      standing near the door; he saw it all. Daisy turned very pale and looked
      at her mother, but Mrs. Miller was humbly unconscious of any violation of
      the usual social forms. She appeared, indeed, to have felt an incongruous
      impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them. &ldquo;Good
      night, Mrs. Walker,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had a beautiful evening. You see, if
      I let Daisy come to parties without me, I don&rsquo;t want her to go away
      without me.&rdquo; Daisy turned away, looking with a pale, grave face at the
      circle near the door; Winterbourne saw that, for the first moment, she was
      too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation. He on his side was
      greatly touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very cruel,&rdquo; he said to Mrs. Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never enters my drawing room again!&rdquo; replied his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Winterbourne was not to meet her in Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s drawing room, he
      went as often as possible to Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s hotel. The ladies were rarely
      at home, but when he found them, the devoted Giovanelli was always
      present. Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room
      with Daisy alone, Mrs. Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion
      that discretion is the better part of surveillance. Winterbourne noted, at
      first with surprise, that Daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed
      or annoyed by his own entrance; but he very presently began to feel that
      she had no more surprises for him; the unexpected in her behavior was the
      only thing to expect. She showed no displeasure at her tete-a-tete with
      Giovanelli being interrupted; she could chatter as freshly and freely with
      two gentlemen as with one; there was always, in her conversation, the same
      odd mixture of audacity and puerility. Winterbourne remarked to himself
      that if she was seriously interested in Giovanelli, it was very singular
      that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their
      interviews; and he liked her the more for her innocent-looking
      indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor. He could hardly
      have said why, but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous. At
      the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the reader&rsquo;s part, I may
      affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him, it
      very often seemed to Winterbourne among the possibilities that, given
      certain contingencies, he should be afraid&mdash;literally afraid&mdash;of
      these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of
      Daisy Miller. It must be added that this sentiment was not altogether
      flattering to Daisy; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his
      apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was evidently very much interested in Giovanelli. She looked at
      him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to
      do that; she was constantly &ldquo;chaffing&rdquo; and abusing him. She appeared
      completely to have forgotten that Winterbourne had said anything to
      displease her at Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s little party. One Sunday afternoon, having
      gone to St. Peter&rsquo;s with his aunt, Winterbourne perceived Daisy strolling
      about the great church in company with the inevitable Giovanelli.
      Presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to Mrs. Costello.
      This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass, and then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes you so pensive in these days, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not the least idea I was pensive,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very much preoccupied; you are thinking of something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is it,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you accuse me of thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that young lady&rsquo;s&mdash;Miss Baker&rsquo;s, Miss Chandler&rsquo;s&mdash;what&rsquo;s her
      name?&mdash;Miss Miller&rsquo;s intrigue with that little barber&rsquo;s block.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call it an intrigue,&rdquo; Winterbourne asked&mdash;&ldquo;an affair that
      goes on with such peculiar publicity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s their folly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not their merit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Winterbourne, with something of that pensiveness to which
      his aunt had alluded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that there is anything to be called
      an intrigue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried
      away by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are certainly very intimate,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Costello inspected the young couple again with her optical
      instrument. &ldquo;He is very handsome. One easily sees how it is. She thinks
      him the most elegant man in the world, the finest gentleman. She has never
      seen anything like him; he is better, even, than the courier. It was the
      courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in marrying the
      young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she thinks of marrying him,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;and I
      don&rsquo;t believe he hopes to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be very sure she thinks of nothing. She goes on from day to day,
      from hour to hour, as they did in the Golden Age. I can imagine nothing
      more vulgar. And at the same time,&rdquo; added Mrs. Costello, &ldquo;depend upon it
      that she may tell you any moment that she is &lsquo;engaged.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is more than Giovanelli expects,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Giovanelli?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little Italian. I have asked questions about him and learned
      something. He is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. I believe
      he is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. But he doesn&rsquo;t move in what
      are called the first circles. I think it is really not absolutely
      impossible that the courier introduced him. He is evidently immensely
      charmed with Miss Miller. If she thinks him the finest gentleman in the
      world, he, on his side, has never found himself in personal contact with
      such splendor, such opulence, such expensiveness as this young lady&rsquo;s. And
      then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting. I rather
      doubt that he dreams of marrying her. That must appear to him too
      impossible a piece of luck. He has nothing but his handsome face to offer,
      and there is a substantial Mr. Miller in that mysterious land of dollars.
      Giovanelli knows that he hasn&rsquo;t a title to offer. If he were only a count
      or a marchese! He must wonder at his luck, at the way they have taken him
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks Miss Miller a young
      lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very true,&rdquo; Winterbourne pursued, &ldquo;that Daisy and her mamma have
      not yet risen to that stage of&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;of
      culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. I
      believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but the avvocato can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the observation excited by Daisy&rsquo;s &ldquo;intrigue,&rdquo; Winterbourne gathered
      that day at St. Peter&rsquo;s sufficient evidence. A dozen of the American
      colonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs. Costello, who sat on a little
      portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters. The vesper
      service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the
      adjacent choir, and meanwhile, between Mrs. Costello and her friends,
      there was a great deal said about poor little Miss Miller&rsquo;s going really
      &ldquo;too far.&rdquo; Winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard, but when,
      coming out upon the great steps of the church, he saw Daisy, who had
      emerged before him, get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away
      through the cynical streets of Rome, he could not deny to himself that she
      was going very far indeed. He felt very sorry for her&mdash;not exactly
      that he believed that she had completely lost her head, but because it was
      painful to hear so much that was pretty, and undefended, and natural
      assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder. He made an
      attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Miller. He met one day in the
      Corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come out of the Doria
      Palace, where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery. His
      friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by
      Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace, and then said,
      &ldquo;And in the same cabinet, by the way, I had the pleasure of contemplating
      a picture of a different kind&mdash;that pretty American girl whom you
      pointed out to me last week.&rdquo; In answer to Winterbourne&rsquo;s inquiries, his
      friend narrated that the pretty American girl&mdash;prettier than ever&mdash;was
      seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal
      portrait was enshrined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was her companion?&rdquo; asked Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole. The girl is
      delightfully pretty, but I thought I understood from you the other day
      that she was a young lady du meilleur monde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she is!&rdquo; answered Winterbourne; and having assured himself that his
      informant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before, he
      jumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Miller. She was at home; but
      she apologized to him for receiving him in Daisy&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone out somewhere with Mr. Giovanelli,&rdquo; said Mrs. Miller. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      always going round with Mr. Giovanelli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed that they are very intimate,&rdquo; Winterbourne observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it seems as if they couldn&rsquo;t live without each other!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Miller. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a real gentleman, anyhow. I keep telling Daisy she&rsquo;s
      engaged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does Daisy say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she says she isn&rsquo;t engaged. But she might as well be!&rdquo; this impartial
      parent resumed; &ldquo;she goes on as if she was. But I&rsquo;ve made Mr. Giovanelli
      promise to tell me, if SHE doesn&rsquo;t. I should want to write to Mr. Miller
      about it&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne replied that he certainly should; and the state of mind of
      Daisy&rsquo;s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental
      vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her
      upon her guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this Daisy was never at home, and Winterbourne ceased to meet her at
      the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he perceived, these
      shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far.
      They ceased to invite her; and they intimated that they desired to express
      to observant Europeans the great truth that, though Miss Daisy Miller was
      a young American lady, her behavior was not representative&mdash;was
      regarded by her compatriots as abnormal. Winterbourne wondered how she
      felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her, and
      sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all. He said
      to himself that she was too light and childish, too uncultivated and
      unreasoning, too provincial, to have reflected upon her ostracism, or even
      to have perceived it. Then at other moments he believed that she carried
      about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant,
      passionate, perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she
      produced. He asked himself whether Daisy&rsquo;s defiance came from the
      consciousness of innocence, or from her being, essentially, a young person
      of the reckless class. It must be admitted that holding one&rsquo;s self to a
      belief in Daisy&rsquo;s &ldquo;innocence&rdquo; came to seem to Winterbourne more and more a
      matter of fine-spun gallantry. As I have already had occasion to relate,
      he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young
      lady; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her
      eccentricities were generic, national, and how far they were personal.
      From either view of them he had somehow missed her, and now it was too
      late. She was &ldquo;carried away&rdquo; by Mr. Giovanelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after his brief interview with her mother, he encountered her
      in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of the
      Caesars. The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume,
      and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender verdure.
      Daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin
      that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental
      inscriptions. It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as just
      then. He stood, looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color
      that remotely encircles the city, inhaling the softly humid odors, and
      feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm
      themselves in mysterious interfusion. It seemed to him also that Daisy had
      never looked so pretty, but this had been an observation of his whenever
      he met her. Giovanelli was at her side, and Giovanelli, too, wore an
      aspect of even unwonted brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Daisy, &ldquo;I should think you would be lonesome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonesome?&rdquo; asked Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always going round by yourself. Can&rsquo;t you get anyone to walk with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so fortunate,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;as your companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giovanelli, from the first, had treated Winterbourne with distinguished
      politeness. He listened with a deferential air to his remarks; he laughed
      punctiliously at his pleasantries; he seemed disposed to testify to his
      belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man. He carried himself in
      no degree like a jealous wooer; he had obviously a great deal of tact; he
      had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him. It even
      seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a certain
      mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with him&mdash;to
      say to him, as an intelligent man, that, bless you, HE knew how
      extraordinary was this young lady, and didn&rsquo;t flatter himself with
      delusive&mdash;or at least TOO delusive&mdash;hopes of matrimony and
      dollars. On this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a
      sprig of almond blossom, which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why you say that,&rdquo; said Daisy, watching Giovanelli. &ldquo;Because you
      think I go round too much with HIM.&rdquo; And she nodded at her attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one thinks so&mdash;if you care to know,&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I care to know!&rdquo; Daisy exclaimed seriously. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
      believe it. They are only pretending to be shocked. They don&rsquo;t really care
      a straw what I do. Besides, I don&rsquo;t go round so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will find they do care. They will show it disagreeably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy looked at him a moment. &ldquo;How disagreeably?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you noticed anything?&rdquo; Winterbourne asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed you. But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the
      first time I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find I am not so stiff as several others,&rdquo; said Winterbourne,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I find it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By going to see the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will they do to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will give you the cold shoulder. Do you know what that means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was looking at him intently; she began to color. &ldquo;Do you mean as
      Mrs. Walker did the other night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Winterbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away at Giovanelli, who was decorating himself with his almond
      blossom. Then looking back at Winterbourne, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you would
      let people be so unkind!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you would say something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do say something;&rdquo; and he paused a moment. &ldquo;I say that your mother
      tells me that she believes you are engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she does,&rdquo; said Daisy very simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne began to laugh. &ldquo;And does Randolph believe it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Randolph doesn&rsquo;t believe anything,&rdquo; said Daisy. Randolph&rsquo;s
      skepticism excited Winterbourne to further hilarity, and he observed that
      Giovanelli was coming back to them. Daisy, observing it too, addressed
      herself again to her countryman. &ldquo;Since you have mentioned it,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;I AM engaged.&rdquo; * * * Winterbourne looked at her; he had stopped laughing.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe!&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a moment; and then, &ldquo;Yes, I believe it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;I am not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the
      enclosure, so that Winterbourne, who had but lately entered, presently
      took leave of them. A week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa
      on the Caelian Hill, and, on arriving, dismissed his hired vehicle. The
      evening was charming, and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking
      home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past the vaguely lighted
      monuments of the Forum. There was a waning moon in the sky, and her
      radiance was not brilliant, but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain
      which seemed to diffuse and equalize it. When, on his return from the
      villa (it was eleven o&rsquo;clock), Winterbourne approached the dusky circle of
      the Colosseum, it recurred to him, as a lover of the picturesque, that the
      interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well worth a glance. He turned
      aside and walked to one of the empty arches, near which, as he observed,
      an open carriage&mdash;one of the little Roman streetcabs&mdash;was
      stationed. Then he passed in, among the cavernous shadows of the great
      structure, and emerged upon the clear and silent arena. The place had
      never seemed to him more impressive. One-half of the gigantic circus was
      in deep shade, the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk. As he stood
      there he began to murmur Byron&rsquo;s famous lines, out of &ldquo;Manfred,&rdquo; but
      before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal
      meditations in the Colosseum are recommended by the poets, they are
      deprecated by the doctors. The historic atmosphere was there, certainly;
      but the historic atmosphere, scientifically considered, was no better than
      a villainous miasma. Winterbourne walked to the middle of the arena, to
      take a more general glance, intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat.
      The great cross in the center was covered with shadow; it was only as he
      drew near it that he made it out distinctly. Then he saw that two persons
      were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base. One of these was
      a woman, seated; her companion was standing in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the sound of the woman&rsquo;s voice came to him distinctly in the
      warm night air. &ldquo;Well, he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers
      may have looked at the Christian martyrs!&rdquo; These were the words he heard,
      in the familiar accent of Miss Daisy Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope he is not very hungry,&rdquo; responded the ingenious Giovanelli.
      &ldquo;He will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with a
      sort of relief. It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon
      the ambiguity of Daisy&rsquo;s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read.
      She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to
      respect. He stood there, looking at her&mdash;looking at her companion and
      not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have been
      more brightly visible. He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so
      much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller. Then, as he was
      going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the fear that he was
      doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing
      unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism.
      He turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he
      heard Daisy speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it was Mr. Winterbourne! He saw me, and he cuts me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at
      injured innocence! But he wouldn&rsquo;t cut her. Winterbourne came forward
      again and went toward the great cross. Daisy had got up; Giovanelli lifted
      his hat. Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness, from
      a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl lounging away the
      evening in this nest of malaria. What if she WERE a clever little
      reprobate? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa. &ldquo;How long
      have you been here?&rdquo; he asked almost brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy, lovely in the flattering moonlight, looked at him a moment. Then&mdash;&ldquo;All
      the evening,&rdquo; she answered, gently. * * * &ldquo;I never saw anything so
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;that you will not think Roman fever
      very pretty. This is the way people catch it. I wonder,&rdquo; he added, turning
      to Giovanelli, &ldquo;that you, a native Roman, should countenance such a
      terrible indiscretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the handsome native, &ldquo;for myself I am not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither am I&mdash;for you! I am speaking for this young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giovanelli lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth.
      But he took Winterbourne&rsquo;s rebuke with docility. &ldquo;I told the signorina it
      was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever prudent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was sick, and I don&rsquo;t mean to be!&rdquo; the signorina declared. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t look like much, but I&rsquo;m healthy! I was bound to see the Colosseum by
      moonlight; I shouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to go home without that; and we have
      had the most beautiful time, haven&rsquo;t we, Mr. Giovanelli? If there has been
      any danger, Eugenio can give me some pills. He has got some splendid
      pills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should advise you,&rdquo; said Winterbourne, &ldquo;to drive home as fast as
      possible and take one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is very wise,&rdquo; Giovanelli rejoined. &ldquo;I will go and make sure
      the carriage is at hand.&rdquo; And he went forward rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy followed with Winterbourne. He kept looking at her; she seemed not
      in the least embarrassed. Winterbourne said nothing; Daisy chattered about
      the beauty of the place. &ldquo;Well, I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one good thing.&rdquo; Then, noticing Winterbourne&rsquo;s
      silence, she asked him why he didn&rsquo;t speak. He made no answer; he only
      began to laugh. They passed under one of the dark archways; Giovanelli was
      in front with the carriage. Here Daisy stopped a moment, looking at the
      young American. &ldquo;DID you believe I was engaged, the other day?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I believed the other day,&rdquo; said Winterbourne,
      still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you believe now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or
      not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt the young girl&rsquo;s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick
      gloom of the archway; she was apparently going to answer. But Giovanelli
      hurried her forward. &ldquo;Quick! quick!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if we get in by midnight we
      are quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daisy took her seat in the carriage, and the fortunate Italian placed
      himself beside her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget Eugenio&rsquo;s pills!&rdquo; said Winterbourne as
      he lifted his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Daisy in a little strange tone, &ldquo;whether I have Roman
      fever or not!&rdquo; Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled
      away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that he
      had encountered Miss Miller, at midnight, in the Colosseum with a
      gentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her
      having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of
      the little American circle, and commented accordingly. Winterbourne
      reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after
      Daisy&rsquo;s return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter
      and the cab driver. But the young man was conscious, at the same moment,
      that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little
      American flirt should be &ldquo;talked about&rdquo; by low-minded menials. These
      people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the little
      American flirt was alarmingly ill. Winterbourne, when the rumor came to
      him, immediately went to the hotel for more news. He found that two or
      three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were being
      entertained in Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s salon by Randolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going round at night,&rdquo; said Randolph&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what made her
      sick. She&rsquo;s always going round at night. I shouldn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d want to,
      it&rsquo;s so plaguy dark. You can&rsquo;t see anything here at night, except when
      there&rsquo;s a moon. In America there&rsquo;s always a moon!&rdquo; Mrs. Miller was
      invisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of her
      society. It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne went often to ask for news of her, and once he saw Mrs.
      Miller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise, perfectly
      composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious nurse. She
      talked a good deal about Dr. Davis, but Winterbourne paid her the
      compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such a
      monstrous goose. &ldquo;Daisy spoke of you the other day,&rdquo; she said to him.
      &ldquo;Half the time she doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s saying, but that time I think
      she did. She gave me a message she told me to tell you. She told me to
      tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian. I am sure I
      am very glad; Mr. Giovanelli hasn&rsquo;t been near us since she was taken ill.
      I thought he was so much of a gentleman; but I don&rsquo;t call that very
      polite! A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking
      Daisy round at night. Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I&rsquo;m a lady. I
      would scorn to scold him. Anyway, she says she&rsquo;s not engaged. I don&rsquo;t know
      why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times, &lsquo;Mind you tell
      Mr. Winterbourne.&rsquo; And then she told me to ask if you remembered the time
      you went to that castle in Switzerland. But I said I wouldn&rsquo;t give any
      such messages as that. Only, if she is not engaged, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m glad to
      know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, as Winterbourne had said, it mattered very little. A week after this,
      the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever. Daisy&rsquo;s
      grave was in the little Protestant cemetery, in an angle of the wall of
      imperial Rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers.
      Winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other mourners, a
      number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady&rsquo;s career would
      have led you to expect. Near him stood Giovanelli, who came nearer still
      before Winterbourne turned away. Giovanelli was very pale: on this
      occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish to say
      something. At last he said, &ldquo;She was the most beautiful young lady I ever
      saw, and the most amiable;&rdquo; and then he added in a moment, &ldquo;and she was
      the most innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words, &ldquo;And the most
      innocent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most innocent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne felt sore and angry. &ldquo;Why the devil,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;did you take
      her to that fatal place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giovanelli&rsquo;s urbanity was apparently imperturbable. He looked on the
      ground a moment, and then he said, &ldquo;For myself I had no fear; and she
      wanted to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was no reason!&rdquo; Winterbourne declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subtle Roman again dropped his eyes. &ldquo;If she had lived, I should have
      got nothing. She would never have married me, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would never have married you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a moment I hoped so. But no. I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance
      among the April daisies. When he turned away again, Mr. Giovanelli, with
      his light, slow step, had retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne almost immediately left Rome; but the following summer he
      again met his aunt, Mrs. Costello at Vevey. Mrs. Costello was fond of
      Vevey. In the interval Winterbourne had often thought of Daisy Miller and
      her mystifying manners. One day he spoke of her to his aunt&mdash;said it
      was on his conscience that he had done her injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Costello. &ldquo;How did your injustice
      affect her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sent me a message before her death which I didn&rsquo;t understand at the
      time; but I have understood it since. She would have appreciated one&rsquo;s
      esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a modest way,&rdquo; asked Mrs. Costello, &ldquo;of saying that she would
      have reciprocated one&rsquo;s affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winterbourne offered no answer to this question; but he presently said,
      &ldquo;You were right in that remark that you made last summer. I was booked to
      make a mistake. I have lived too long in foreign parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he went back to live at Geneva, whence there continue to
      come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn: a report
      that he is &ldquo;studying&rdquo; hard&mdash;an intimation that he is much interested
      in a very clever foreign lady.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
